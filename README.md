## Description
This project creates a seamless server-side application which easily stores and retrieves inventory for an online marketplace. Utilizing SQL, ExpressJS, Sequelize, and dotenv, I was able to create an accessible API for all the necessary information I would need as both a consumer and a marketplace owner. All in all, this taught me how many things a developer has to keep track of when considering the full stack of technologies.

## Installation
Download this repositroy through GitHub. Other required installations: NodeJS, and SQL.

## Usage
After installing the necessary packages with NodeJS (use the command 'npm i' once inside the folder with the server.js file), as well as preparing the SQL instance on your computer, seed the data by running 'node seeds/index.js' and then 'node server.js' to start the server. Utilizing either your browser or a third-party application such as insomnia, you can access the routes of the API to interact with the database.
